This project offers a deep learning-based solution for real-time traffic congestion analysis. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system classifies road images into **High Congestion** and **Low Congestion** categories. The core focus is on achieving high accuracy by comparing a custom-built CNN against state-of-the-art pre-trained models like **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **MobileNetV2** through Transfer Learning.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **High-Accuracy Classification:** Differentiates between high and low traffic congestion states from static images.
* **Comparative Model Analysis:** Trains, evaluates, and compares four distinct CNN architectures to identify the optimal model.
* **Transfer Learning:** Implements transfer learning with VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 to leverage pre-trained weights for superior performance.
* **Data Augmentation:** Utilizes Keras's data augmentation capabilities to create a more robust and generalized model, preventing overfitting.
* **Modular & Reproducible:** The code is structured into clean, modular scripts for easy understanding, execution, and reproduction of results.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### 1. Dataset Setup

This project uses a curated subset of the **Traffic Management - Image Dataset** from Kaggle.

* **Source**: [Traffic Management - Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satyampd/traffic-management-image-dataset)
* **Instructions**:
    1.  Download the dataset from the source link.
    2.  In your local project's `dataset/` directory, create two empty folders: `High_Congestion` and `Low_Congestion`.
    3.  Copy all images from the downloaded `train/dense traffic` folder and paste them into your `High_Congestion` folder.
    4.  Copy all images from the downloaded `train/sparse traffic` folder and paste them into your `Low_Congestion` folder.

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/traffic_congestion_project.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/traffic_congestion_project.git)

# Navigate to the project directory
cd traffic_congestion_project

# Install the required Python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Usage
All scripts are run from the command line inside the scripts/ directory.

Bash

# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts
Training the Models (Run these one by one):

Bash

# 1. Train the Custom CNN
python train_cnn.py

# 2. Train VGG16
python train_transfer.py --model vgg16

# 3. Train ResNet50
python train_transfer.py --model resnet50

# 4. Train MobileNetV2
python train_transfer.py --model mobilenet
Evaluating the Models:

After all models are trained, run the evaluation script to generate reports and confusion matrices.

Bash

python evaluate.py
📈 Model Performance & Comparison
The evaluation script generates a detailed classification report for each model. The results clearly indicate that transfer learning models provide a substantial improvement over a CNN built from scratch.

Model	Final Accuracy	Key Observation
Custom CNN	89%	Good baseline, but struggles with complex scenes.
VGG16 (Transfer)	96%	Huge improvement, proving the value of pre-training.
MobileNetV2 (Transfer)	98%	Excellent accuracy, highly efficient model.
ResNet50 (Transfer)	99%	Best performance, nearly flawless classification.

Export to Sheets
The superior performance of ResNet50 can be attributed to its deep residual architecture, which allows it to learn more complex features from the images without suffering from vanishing gradients—a common problem in very deep networks.

💡 Future Work
Real-time Implementation: Adapt the system to process live video feeds from traffic cameras using OpenCV.

Web Application: Deploy the winning model as an interactive web application using Flask or Streamlit where users can upload their own traffic images for classification.

Expand Classification: Incorporate more classes like accident, road work, or fire to build a comprehensive traffic event detection system.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilize tools like KerasTuner or Optuna to systematically find the optimal hyperparameters and potentially increase accuracy further.
